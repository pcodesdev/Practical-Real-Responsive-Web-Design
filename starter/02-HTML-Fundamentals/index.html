        All modern websites and web applications are built using three
        fundamental technologies: <em>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</em>. These are
        the languages of the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about,
        and why you too should learn it.
      </p>

      <h3>What is HTMl</h3>
      <p>
        HTML stands for <span><strong>H</strong></span
        >yper<span><strong>T</strong></span
        >ext <span><strong>M</strong></span
        >arkup <span><strong>L</strong></span
        >anguage. It is a markup language used for creating web pages and
        applications. HTML consists of a series of tags and attributes that are
        used to describe the structure and content of a web page. Web browsers
        use HTML to render web pages, allowing users to view text, images,
        videos, and other content on the internet. HTML is a fundamental
        technology for creating websites and is often used in conjunction with
        other web development technologies like CSS and JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        In HTML, each element is made up of 4 parts but we have elements with
        self closing tags like img:
      </p>
      <!-- ordered list -->
      <ol>
        <!-- list items -->
        <li>
          Start tag: This is the first part of the element, enclosed in angle
          brackets, and indicates the type of element.
        </li>
        <li>
          Attributes: These are optional and provide additional information
          about the element, such as its class, id, or style.
        </li>
        <li>
          Content: This is the text, images, or other elements contained within
          the element.
        </li>
        <li>
          End tag: This is the last part of the element, also enclosed in angle
          brackets, and indicates the end of the element.
        </li>
        <li>
          Self-closing tag: Some elements, such as images or line breaks, do not
          require an end tag and can instead use a self-closing tag, which ends
          with a forward slash inside the angle brackets./li>
        </li>
      </ol>
